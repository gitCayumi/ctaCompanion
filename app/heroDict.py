Her “Team” buff is a self buff that gives her massive amounts of attack. This allows her to focus on other sources of damage. Her normal attack has a chance to stun, and her sp2 is a small aoe stun. Most end game teams use few front line heroes, so this isn’t that important, but it can help take out late game teams. It does give a full dps team some crowd control."],
