<br><br>
## Description & Features
Players can sign up and submit the following information:
- Star level, Awaken, Weapon level and Medals for each hero
- Essential Rune Values for each hero

Algorithms based on input above calculate and return the following:
- Hero Collection; browse, sort and filter your heroes by various stats
- Ability to navigate to each hero for additional information 
- Comprehensive progress by rarity and element

- Optimal team composition for max damage for each boss in Slay Boss Events

Possible future additions:
